# Self-improving tic tac toe implementation

This tic tac toe implementation is supposed to learn from its mistakes! State is maintained as two integers, one for each
player. Each bit signifies a checked/unchecked square. Biwise operations (and / or / shift) are used to update board state, 
detect outcomes, find free squares etc.

The game does not try to evaluate moves, it picks random moves that are valid (unchecked squares) and not blacklisted.The
game learns by blacklisting moves that lead to defeat. If all moves in a certain position lead to defeat, the move into that
position is blacklisted. Winning moves are remembered and used rather than random moves.

The learning algorithm applies to the mirror image (across the y-axis) of the board as well as the actual board setup. This 
makes the system learn twice as fast as the na√Øve implementation. With rotation taken into account, the system will learn up
to 8 times as fast.

Winning and losing moves will be reported to the backend and stored there. The game will try to fetch this data on page load.
If the system variable DATABASE_URL is set to a valid postgres URL, those moves will be persisted in two tables.

## Development mode

To start the Figwheel compiler, navigate to the project folder and run the following command in the terminal:

```
lein figwheel
```

Figwheel will automatically push cljs changes to the browser. 
The server will be available at [http://localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449) once Figwheel starts up.

Figwheel also starts `nREPL` using the value of the `:nrepl-port` in the `:figwheel`
config found in `project.clj`. By default the port is set to `7002`.

The figwheel server can have unexpected behaviors in some situations such as when using
websockets. In this case it's recommended to run a standalone instance of a web server as follows:

```
lein do clean, run
```

The application will now be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).


### Optional development tools

Start the browser REPL:

```
$ lein repl
```
The Jetty server can be started by running:

```clojure
(start-server)
```
and stopped by running:
```clojure
(stop-server)
```


## Building for release

```
lein do clean, uberjar
```
